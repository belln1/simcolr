Title: Simulate Collusion Based on Stochastic Interest Rates
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(person("Nicole", "Bellert", , email="bell@zhaw.ch", role = c("aut", "cre")))
Description: Simulation of industries with collusive and non-collusive periods over time, detected and undetected, based on stochastic interest rates and incentive compatibility constraints (Stigler (1964), Harrington and Chang (2009), Bos et al (2018)). This simulation is described in detail in the paper "Simulating Collusion: Challenging Conventional Estimation Methods" by Bellert and GÃ¼nster (2025). The package provides a function sim_col_r() that can be used to generate a ground-truth panel dataset for collusion, and a function get_durations() that generates a cross-sectional dataset from the panel data.
